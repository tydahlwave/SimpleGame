# A Simple Game
A simple collection game developed for CPE 476 at Cal Poly.

The goal is to refamiarize ourselves with C++ and OpenGL before implementing a complex game.

Requirements are specified [here](lab1_17.pdf).

### Required Features
1. Ground plane
2. Player character capable of movement along the ground
3. Game camera attached to the player
4. Objects that spawn over time and move along the ground (must face in direction of movement)
5. Collisions
6. Collision avoidance for the spawned objects
7. Modification of the spawned objects by the player when collision occurs (stopping, exploding, change color, etc)
8. Accurate shading
